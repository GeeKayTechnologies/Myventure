                Nutrient Management :: Fertilizers
                FERTILIZER
                
                Fertilizer is any material of natural or synthetic origin added to the soil to supply one or more plant nutrients.
                
                
                CLASSIFICATION OF FERTILISERS
                
                Fertilisers
                1. Straight fertilizers:  Straight fertilizers are those which supply only one primary plant nutrient, namely nitrogen or phosphorus or potassium. 
                eg. Urea, ammonium sulphate, potassium chloride and potassium sulphate.
                
                2. Complex fertilizers:  Complex fertilizers contain two or three primary plant nutrients of which two primary nutrients are in chemical combination. These fertilisers are usually produced in granular form. 
                eg. Diammonium phosphate, nitrophosphates and ammonium phosphate.
                
                3. Mixed fertilizers: are physical mixtures of straight fertilisers. They contain two or three primary plant nutrients. Mixed fertilisers are made by thoroughly mixing the ingredients either mechanically or manually.
                Fertilisers can also be classified based on physical form:
                
                Solid
                Liquid fertilizers
                Fertilizer
                 
                
                
                Solid fertilizers are in several forms viz.
                
                Powder (single superphosphate),
                Crystals (ammonium sulphate),
                Prills (urea, diammonium phosphate, superphosphate),
                Granules (Holland granules),
                Supergranules (urea supergranules) and
                Briquettes (urea briquettes).
                            
                Urea prills                         Granulated urea                  Ammonium sulphate
                
                Liquid fertilizers:
                
                Liquid form fertilizers are applied with irrigation water or for direct application.
                Ease of handling, less labour requirement and possibility of mixing with herbicides have made the liquid fertilisers more acceptable to farmers.

                Nitrogenous fertilizer 
                
                
                Ammoniacal
                Nitrate

                Nitrate
                
                Amide fertilizer

                Ammonium chloride

                Calcium Nitrate
                Potassium Nitrate
                Ammonium Nitrate
                Calcium Ammonium Nitrate
                Ammonium Sulphate Nitrate
                Urea
                Calcium Cynamide
                A. Nitrogenous fertilizers
                
                Nitrogenous fertilizers take the foremost place among fertilizers since the deficiency of nitrogen in the soil is the foremost and crops respond to nitrogen better than to other nutrients.
                More than 80 per cent of the fertilizers used in this country are made up of nitrogenous fertilizers, particularly urea.
                It is extremely efficient in increasing the production of crops and the possibilities of its economic production are unlimited.
                The nitrogenous fertilizers can be further classified as given below:
                1. Ammoniacal fertilizers
                
                Ammoniacal fertilizers contain the nutrient nitrogen in the form of ammonium or ammonia.
                Ammoniacal fertilizers are readily soluble in water and therefore readily available to crops.
                Except rice, all crops absorb nitrogen in nitrate form. These fertilizers are resistant to leaching loss, as the ammonium ions get readily absorbed on the colloidal complex of the soil.
                a) Ammonium sulphate [(NH4)2 S04]
                
                It is a white salt completely soluble in water containing 20.6 .per cent of nitrogen and 24.0 per cent of sulphur.
                It is used advantageously in rice and jute cultivation.
                It is easy to handle and it stores well under dry conditions. But during rainy season, it sometimes forms lumps.
                It can be applied before sowing, at the time of sowing or as a top-dressing to the growing crop.
                b) Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)
                
                It is a white salt contains 26.0 per cent of nitrogen.
                It is usually not recommended for tomato, tobacco and such other crops as may be injured by chlorine.

                <p>
                    A seed is an embryonic plant enclosed in a protective outer covering. The formation of the seed is part of the process of reproduction in seed plants, the spermatophytes, including the gymnosperm and angiosperm plants.

Seeds are the product of the ripened ovule, after fertilization by pollen and some growth within the mother plant. The embryo develops from the zygote, and the seed coat from the integuments of the ovule.

Seeds have been an important development in the reproduction and success of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants, relative to more primitive plants such as ferns, mosses and liverworts, which do not have seeds and use water-dependent means to propagate themselves. Seed plants now dominate biological niches on land, from forests to grasslands both in hot and cold climates.

The term "seed" also has a general meaning that antedates the above – anything that can be sown, e.g. "seed" potatoes, "seeds" of corn or sunflower "seeds". In the case of sunflower and corn "seeds", what is sown is the seed enclosed in a shell or husk, whereas the potato is a tuber.
